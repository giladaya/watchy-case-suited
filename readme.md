# Case design for the Watchy open source watch
Designed by Gilad Dayagi using [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery).

Includes a case body, top cover and usb plug.  
No screws are needed.  
Adjust the parameters at the top for your needs. 

## Design goals
- As small case as possible 
- Reliably held together
- Visually appealing
- Only expose the screen area at the top
- Supply some protection for the screen

## Notes
- As the screen is placed manually the top may not fit exactly - adjust the `p_screen_from_pcb_top` parameter to suit your copy.
- Printing the top may be tricky, depending on your printer capabilities. 
You may want to experiment with different orientations and support settings.
